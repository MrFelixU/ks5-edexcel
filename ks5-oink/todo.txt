- add FAQs and explains HOW TO CONTRIBUTE to the scheme, and HOW to
  manage / update it, in other words some documentation!!

o configure some tests (and projects) to go with the units, display
  and link to them in the scheme

  x complete the Y7 (E,C,S 8) test config

  x find and put in tests for the camess 9 schemes, as well as the
    tests from last year for the other schemes

  - link up the test / project files / directories - let's look in
    those directories to see if there's anything there, then display a
    link to that directory

- try out some other schemes, e.g. a KS4 or KS5 one as proof of concept

x construct the take-home cards

  x fix print styling

  x make into pdfs, linked from the scheme

x make parent-version, without the test links in there !!!

x make the question-by-question analysis booklets

x make a print.css to allow pretty printing

x an index.html which launches people into the different schemes,

x fix the set markers (broken now that we've done away with set number
  and year number, replaced with titles)
