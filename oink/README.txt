HOW TO USE THE "OINK" scheme of work generator
----------------------------------------------

Edit the configuration file "settings.ini" to set the correct target directory
(folder) for where the scheme should be set up.

That folder should contain all the relevant folders for resources referenced in
the config files, e.g. the unit detail files, or textbook links, tests, etc.

Also check that the config_folder is correctly set - this folder should contain
all the files which detail the classes, schemes, units, etc.
